Core Features to Build
Phase 1 - Basic Chat
* WebSocket connection management
* Simple message broadcasting
* Basic room creation and joining
* One to one messaging
Phase 2 - User Management
* User authentication and registration
* User presence (online/offline status)
* Username display in messages
Phase 3 - Advanced Features
* Message history persistence
* Private messaging
* Room permissions (public/private rooms)
* Typing indicators
* Message reactions
Key Technical Components
WebSocket Manager


python
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: Dict[str, List[WebSocket]] = {}
    
    async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket, room_id: str):
        # Handle new connections
    
    async def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket, room_id: str):
        # Clean up disconnections
    
    async def broadcast_to_room(self, message: str, room_id: str):
        # Send message to all users in room
Database Models (using SQLAlchemy)
* Users table
* Rooms table
* Messages table
* UserRooms (many-to-many relationship)
Authentication Integration
* JWT tokens for WebSocket authentication
* Session management for persistent connections
Learning Objectives
This project will teach you:
* WebSocket lifecycle management
* Real-time event handling
* Connection state management
* Database design for chat systems
* Async programming patterns
* Error handling in real-time systems
Suggested Tech Stack
* FastAPI + WebSockets
* SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
* Redis (optional, for scaling and session storage)
* JWT for authentication
* Pydantic for message validation
Would you like me to help you start with a specific part? I'd recommend beginning with the basic WebSocket connection manager and simple message broadcasting, then gradually adding complexity. Which aspect would you like to dive into first?
